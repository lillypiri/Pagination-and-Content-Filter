#### Project 2 📒🎓

## Pagination & Content Filter

###### This is the second of twelve projects for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.


👩‍💻  I've aimed for Exceeds Expectations by expanding the project as follows:

- Included a search component so that a user can search for a particular student or students.
- When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search.
- If no matches are found by the search, there is a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
- Tested on Chrome (Version 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit)), Firefox (54.0.1 (64-bit), & Safari (Version 10.1.2 (12603.3.8)).
